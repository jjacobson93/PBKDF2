A set of crypto libraries for Swift, written in Swift.
 
## MD5
 
PBKDF2 is a library that provides PBKDF2 key derivation support on top of CryptoEssentials using your preferred hashing function with HMAC.

## Usage

```swift
var passwordBytes = [UInt8]("hunter2".utf8), salt = [UInt8]("r4nd0ms4lT!".utf8)

let sha1hash = try! PBKDF2<SHA1>.calculate(passwordBytes, salt: salt, iterations: 10000)
let sha256hash = try! PBKDF2<SHA2<SHA256>>.calculate(passwordBytes, salt: salt, iterations: 10000)

// Don't do this.. please
let sha1hash = try! PBKDF2<MD5>.calculate(passwordBytes, salt: salt, iterations: 10000)

print(sha256hash.hexString)
```
