A set of crypto libraries for Swift, written in Swift.
 
## MD5
 
PBKDF2 is a library that provides PBKDF2 key derivation support on top of CryptoEssentials using your preferred hashing function with HMAC.

## Usage

```swift
var passwordBytes = [UInt8](), salt: [UInt8]()
passwordBytes.append(contentsOf: "hunter2".utf8)
salt.append(contentsOf: "r4nd0ms4lT!)

let sha1hash = PBKDF2<SHA1>(passwordBytes, salt: salt, iterations: 10000)
let sha256hash = PBKDF2<SHA2<SHA256>>(passwordBytes, salt: salt, iterations: 10000)

// Don't do this.. please
let md5hash = PBKDF2<MD5>(passwordBytes, salt: salt, iterations: 10000)
```
